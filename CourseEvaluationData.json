Don't bite off more than you can chew and keep your scope narrow throughout the course. Also read other students' outlines because the feedback sessions are really unhelpful if its clear no one has read your stuff."

It will be a great way to learn the names of other people in the concentration (which is nice, but to get to know those people you'll have to do work yourself), and begins to introduce you to some studio techniques. The art context and documents given don't make a lot of sense and often result in meaningless and overintellectualized discussions. There's not a whole lot to get out of tutorial as it is, although Matt seems very helpful. It's a class with a lot of potential and I hope it improves in the coming years. However, don't let this be the course that dissuades you from VES. There are so many other wonderful things about VES.",
      "In theory, a class full of new concentrators seems like a great place to learn about peers and learn about what they make. In reality, I left the class not knowing much more about my fellow concentrators than when I came into the class, which is disappointing. I think if more focus was put on building relationships between students through making, this would have been more enjoyable for me."

In general, this class can be a ton of work outside because of the sheer amount of prep work, filming, and editing that has to happen on your own time, but this doesn't really become a problem until March and April, when crunching on the final film project. However, it's not unmanageable, and the class really is worth taking.",

You pursue whatever you want to pursue. There is total freedom in terms of subject and presentation format. Stephen is a walking encyclopedia of the last 6 decades of art history and a brilliant pedagogue, who has marvelous sense about whom he works with in terms of T.F.s. Phoebe is organized and passionate about the course. Both have broad knowledge of art and open minds and offer nuanced feedback and discussion on all student work. If you have something you want to work on that is unsupported elsewhere in the university, this is your haven."

      "TAKE. THIS. CLASS. This class was an incredible experience, and it changed the way I think about art and the world in general. Catarina is a wonderful instructor and goes out of her way to make art accessible to everyone, including those without any background. The class is consists of a drawing part where Catarina teaches a new technique/ students practice drawing from life and a 'crit' (critique) part where everyone talks about and gives constructive feedback on a person's weekly assignment (which, by the way, I do not recommend starting the night before it is due) as a group. This class will leave you a better artist - Catarina has a unique way of pushing students to experiment more and express their voice in their work. That said, in-class time is not enough to master new techniques and if you really want to develop skill in drawing, you'll have to put in effort on your own time. Overall, this class was a deeply rewarding experience, and I highly recommend lottery-ing for it and praying to the heavens to get a spot.",
      "I highly recommend taking this class. The VES department has amazing resources - you get free pencils, charcoals, erasers, etc. The small class size (around 10-12) makes for a comfortable, supportive environment. Katarina can be abrasive sometimes but is really sweet once you get to know her. The assignments are extremely open-ended so you can pretty much draw whatever you want every time, and they never feel like real work, if you enjoy drawing. Keep in mind that a few people in the class will have had extensive personal drawing/sketching experience despite it being an intro class. My only problem was that I came into this class expecting to learn how to become better at drawing and improve my technique, but I honestly don't think I've improved much in terms of actual technical skill. I wish the teacher had given more comments like \"loosen your arm, you're pressing too hard\", \"hold the pencil like ___ to achieve ___\", \"you need to do ___ to get ____ shape/tone\". Instead, this class seems to focus a lot more on artistic expression and creativity by emphasizing ideas like composition, materials, and theme/subject matter; we tend to get more vague comments more along the lines of \"this curve is beautiful/amazing/wow!\", \"lots of great energy/movement/stuff happening over here\" \"The colors and tone really activate the rest of the space\" - which has its merits too, in that I've become better at anticipating how people will react emotionally to my art. However, I found it a little frustrating, because I did sign up for a drawing class, yet some of the students would bring in collages/paint splatters - it felt like creativity and originality was being valued over precision and aesthetics. To sum it up, I think this class has made me a better artist, but not necessarily a better drawer. Still worth the time, still a learning experience, still lots of fun. Highly recommended, especially if you've never taken a VES class."

If you're a stem major, consider it as an intro class with labs and annoying psets when factoring in your time management as it'll take about the same amount of time. Also note that the class is quite open to interpretation and preference. Accordingly you can balance the class well with something like a thesis as I did, but this freedom also means there's a lack of structure. You'll get to practice your art but if you want to practice technical art you should look into drawing 1 or simply make these technical goals your long term project for this class."

That said, the course is pretty unstructured and really requires students to be quite self-sufficient. You can ask for help if you need it, but I'd recommend picking projects you're genuinely interested in so that you can get the most out of the course. If you put the time and energy in, you'll have a pretty incredible time. That said, it requires many hours a week in class and more outside of class, so be careful about how you fit it into your schedule."

I felt like I learned a lot and understand what's going on in the field now, especially with the great guest lectures. The paper discussions and presentations also really put you at ease for other upper level biology courses. My main reservation about this class is that it isn't well-organized: the lecture slides are inconsistent/unhelpful to study from, we didn't get useful feedback at all during the course (except the graded midterms), and at times we didn't know when our paper discussions would be. The midterms were a bit hard, so if you really want an easy A, this wouldn't be recommended, but as an upper level SCRB course it's probably one of the most interesting ones you could take."

      "The first day of class Shirley will say \"the homeworks take over 20 hours\" and she is not kidding around. She will also say \"if you can't do homework 1 in under 10 hours you should drop the course\" and she isn't kidding around there either. I did homework 1 in 4 hours, felt confident, then homework 2 destroyed me. I spent a lot of time on homeworks from googling obscure error messages, to 100ish long email chains with one of the TFs, to trying to figure out what the question was really asking. The fact that the final was worth the same as a homework helped, because it was pretty much all trick questions and stuff I hadn't thought about much all semester. The sheer volume of material you cover is insane, and supposedly the homeworks and such are LESS work than they were last year. It's worth it if you want to improve your R/Python skills or are interested in any of the topics covered but don't use this class to \"learn to code\", you should already know how when you walk in the door (at least a little bit; if you never heard of ggplot or pandas you may want to wait until you've improved your skills). Don't expect the TFs to be helpful without a lot of work on your end, they tend to be 'computer guys' who have forgotten long ago what newbies find difficult so you will need to ask a lot of \"stupid questions\" and be annoying to get the information you need out of them. Be ready to give up most of your time to this class and do as good as you can on the homeworks so you can afford to blow the final.",
      "This is a great course on bioinformatics, though you shouldn't take it unless you have familiarity with either statistics & CS or biology, or both. There is a decent amount of programming in the course, so if you are unfamiliar with both bio & stat/cs it will be very difficult. Otherwise, the TFs are very helpful, the homeworks are very cool, and the lectures are very helpful."

      "Whether you’re a first-generation Indian-American from an orthodox Tamil Brahmin family, someone who has one Sri Lankan grandparent, or someone who has no background on India, Dravidian languages, or Tamil culture but just wants to take the language because it looks cool, TAKE TAMIL 101B. Since the age of nine, I’ve struggled through years of local Tamil schools taught by volunteer parents in my hometown and have never gotten a grasp of the language. I used to be an embarrassment to the Tamil community in my hometown and to my relatives in India for not being able to speak, read, or write Tamil. Jonathan (the professor) changed that. In such a painless and fun way, too. In just one semester, I can now read Tamil at a decent pace, write full, grammatically-correct sentences, and speak moderately well. Jonathan does wonders. He is so kind, engaging, and inspiring and goes out of his way to help you read, write, and speak Tamil. You never feel bored in class and you’re always having fun, laughing, learning because Jonathan is such a good teacher. Also, Tyler (the TF) is incredible as well. Their passion for and knowledge about Tamil language and culture is truly inspiring. Both of them are extremely responsive and go out of their way to help you and give you feedback, even if it’s the night before the final (literally). Tamil 101B is honestly amazing. I can’t say enough good things about the class, the professor, the TF, and the content! Now I can actually talk to my mom in intelligible Tamil and that is something I am so grateful for because of Tamil 101B.",
      "This is the most fun class I have taken in all my time at Harvard. Jonathan is one of the best teachers I have ever had. Highly highly recommend!"

You will learn a lot about social network analysis, but the workload is really fine (Most of the readings are from textbooks, they are a bit dry but easy to follow, other readings are very interesting research papers. Assignments are not graded but you will get very detailed feedbacks. As for the final project, you will get a lot of help, so no need to worry.)",
      "Sometimes you will have to push yourself to engage more substantively in the course, as the PSETs will not be as rigorous as those from other PSET-heavy classes. Attending section is a helpful way to do this and giving lots of consideration to your final project, but it might also be about delving into the material on your own."

After finishing this course, I feel more prepared in developing research design and building a more holistic approach of data acquisition that goes beyond standard quantitative analysis. I am confident that I could use the skills I gained in this class in areas such as Consulting and other Research based fields as well.",
      "This class is super helpful if you're thinking about completing a research project or conducting a senior thesis and want to workshop different methods! The most helpful aspect was when we practiced each qualitative methods ourselves, wrote memos about the results, and then gained feedback from Prof Mandic about what went well and what could be improved. As someone writing my senior thesis next year, this course has allowed me to think more deeply about how I will go about that process. I wish a little more time could have been spent workshopping our exact materials, rather than more theoretically discussing the pros and cons of the different methods, but overall this class was very helpful."

      "This class has challenged me intellectually in the ways that I hoped college would. Though this course surveys American culture and capitalism since the Gilded Age, we took deep dives each week into fascinating works, which served as lenses into topics like meritocracy, welfare capitalism, and activist business. Ryan is one of the best teachers I've had at college—witty, sharp, caring, and generous, he pushes us to do better by ourselves and by our classmates. He is very clearly invested in our growth and any student would be lucky to take a class with him."

      "This is an excellent, challenging course that will make you walk out of class discussions pondering new ideas every week. While I found it to be intellectually stimulating, it was definitely a lot of work. Make sure you are genuinely interested in the topic before enrolling-- skim over some of the readings in the syllabus and see if they pique your interest. Thankfully I was deeply interested in the material so it ended up being worth it. You are expected to have a solid handle on the readings before coming to class, which is ensured by the weekly reading notes requirement. Slacking on even one of the readings will not be tolerated. Kristin is intense, but she facilitates incredibly interesting discussions. She is knowledgable on the subject, and gives detailed and meaningful feedback.",
      "This course taught me so much. It was very well organized; the content about global slums was incredibly interesting; the methods component (ethnographies) was really awesome to delve into; Kristin's teaching style / support was constantly stellar; and the work load was very manageable."

      "I’ve had overwhelmingly positive experiences with both Social Studies junior tutorials. However, this is hands-down the best course I have taken at Harvard. We began by exploring the questions and trade-offs of reconciliation efforts, looking at transitional justice, truth, morality, and a host of other topic areas. Then, we dove into case studies that brought real lives to the center of our discussions. Professor Hansen guided the course with ease, allowing our discussions to develop organically, yet pushing us on areas we sought to avoid. There are a lot of readings, and you are expected to do all of them. Each week, you will also be asked to submit a response paper. Throughout the semester, each student works on a final research paper that draws on ideas from the course but also dives into new topic areas, particularly as related to your thesis (though it doesn’t have to be). You really should take this tutorial!",

The readings for this course are super interesting & thought-provoking, and they challenged a lot of the assumptions I had about the effects of legal policies/how legal decisions are made. We also had the chance to visit a prison, which - in a very useful way - allowed us to see how some of the theories we read about operated in practice.

      "There's no course like this at Harvard that I've found. If you're interested in public service, especially around housing or urban development; there is no better course. It will teach you to think in a new way about policy issues. You'll learn SO much about Boston and, if you're like me, and didn't engage much with the city, you'll find its actually super fascinating. You'll learn to think far more critically and normatively about crucial issues ranging from gentrification to affordable housing. Prof. Bok is awesome and has the best way of explaining complex philosophical ideas. She's a magician with metaphors. So incredibly intelligent. She makes class fun! (ask her to take your class outside). Nick was awesome as well. The guest speakers are awesome. Can't recommend this class enough! It's so unique.",
      "This is my favorite class from college. Plan to work hard and soak up everything the readings, assignments, and Kenzie have to offer. None of the readings felt extraneous, and the assignments push you in different ways. Kenzie is a masterful teacher, as well as scholar and housing-policy expert. Nick's background in political theory and Fair Housing policy nicely complements Kenzie. I've taken five seminars at Harvard, and this one was by far the best taught. Kenzie gives students plenty of space to think through the readings and concepts but is not afraid to help synthesize our ideas, clarify a concept we misinterpret, or inject a mindblowing nuance. This method synthesizes the concepts nicely. The members of the class built a strong community. It was extremely collaborative, and we were united by a shared interest in justice in housing. One disclaimer: Many students in this class work at Y2Y or HSHS. This class, true to its name, focuses on justice in *housing*. To this extent, most weeks delve into a facet of housing, neighborhoods, communities, or policy. Don't expect to learn a lot about homelessness, but also don't let that dissuade you from taking the class. Housing is so varied, complicated, and nuanced. This class helped me go beyond the housed/homeless binary I often fall into at shelter."

      "I am so grateful for this class. This class was not only educational about the rich history of Chinese immigration in the US, but also helped me learn more about my Asian American identity and current politics around the Asian American community. This course contextualizes the importance of service work in relation to history and the learning never feels trivial. Because the class is so small, the course allows you to meet a group of people that are so dedicated to public service and passionate about the Asian American community, and that is something I hadn't been exposed to before. Nicole is also so willing to help and talk to you, and she is one of the most welcoming and supportive teachers I've had at Harvard. This course will make you think differently about your position as a service provider and your responsibility to your community. Personally, as a Chinese American, it was incredibly rewarding to learn about the history of Chinese people in this country, something I wasn't knowledgeable about before.",
      "As an Asian-American, this was one of the most important courses that I've ever taken at Harvard. This is because the course brought to light historical narratives related to my identity that I never knew existed, and drastically reshaped how I see my place in American society. For instance, not only did we discuss the origins of the Chinese Exclusion Act (which was hardly covered in my American history textbook), we also learned about the racist and xenophobic language fueling its passage, that continue to shape migration policy today and perceptions of Asian-Americans. We also discussed the long history of Asian-American political organizing, which I didn't even know existed, but opened my eyes to the important work being done by other Asian-Americans. One of the most interesting weeks of readings consisted of discussion about the model minority stereotype about Aisha-Americans, and how immigration reform in 1965 directly fuels that stereotype by prioritizing well-educated Asian migrants. That being said, if you're not Asian-American, this course can be super relevant and interesting as well, if you've spent any time doing service work with Asian migrants or are interested in these experiences. Nicole and Jiaying are wonderful course staff who will really make you feel at home in the course, and the readings are so fascinating and will challenge your conceptions of the Chinese immigrant experience in America. Take it!!"

I would love a book we read one week, only to love the book we read the next week even more. The Unbearable Lightness of Being, Notes from Underground, and Darkness at Noon are particularly books you should read at some point in your life. You'll find yourself reading one of the books in a café, and someone random will go up to you and talk to you about the book you're reading. These books have that kind of appeal. Finally, Professor Bolton is very approachable and does an excellent job in facilitating class discussion. He is very down to earth and clearly loves teaching.",
      "I unreservedly recommend this course, with enthusiasm. I am not a student in the Slavic department and I took the course as an elective, and then found it to be one of the best I have taken at Harvard. The Political Novel has taught me a great deal about how novels can consider different ideologies or political visions in a way that has profound implications for our own lives as readers and as politically engaged citizens. It is difficult for me to explain just how rewarding it is to read novels under the tutelage of Professor Bolton. He is a scholar quite unlike any other I have encountered at Harvard. The course is fair, its assignments are by no means burdensome, and the reading list is filled with amazing novels. It is all the more remarkable that a course can impose relatively little requirements on the students, but then engender such an enriching learning experience. To anyone who cares about literature, to anyone who is interested in politics and how it can be represented in fiction, to anyone who values a true educational experience, I do not know how else to say it: take this course."

      "Russian through Pushkin is a unique way to learn Russian for the first time - it combines the traditional speaking/grammar technique with readings from one of Russia's most famous writers/poets. The readings and grammar are tricky and difficult, but Oksana and Maya were super helpful in parsing through the irregularities and the new material. I definitely recommend this course to anyone looking to learn Russian, especially if you're interested in the literature! Be prepared for some frustration (it takes time getting used to a language as foreign as this), but it will be a super rewarding experience.",
      "If you are thinking about taking Russian for the first time, I would recommend you taking this class instead of the elementary level. The first few weeks might be tough, but you will enjoy reading Pushkin! Professor Willis is amazing and the best part of the class is its small size where you really get to know your classmates and teachers."

Also, it is very very worth it to put in the time at the beginning of the course to get your bearings within the language - much much harder to make up ground once you are behind. Also, though vocab quizzes are weekly, they count for very little of your grade so are not as cumbersome as they'd seem."

In class, we have individual presentations of articles about once a week and vocab quizzes about 5 times per semester... the rest of the class is devoted to article discussion.

Your conversational Czech might get a bit better, but the real knowledge gained from this course is about the subject matter — Czech history and culture.

This semester, everyone who wanted to take the course was able to do so, which was great. In the future, however, it would be better in sections of 15-20 students. Also, while every single component of the course (reading, movie, assignment, etc.) was valuable, the organization--at times--seemed less apparent (and some seemed less relevant to the rest of the course in general).

I've never been a person who was into music that much but this course led me to appreciate music like I haven't before. The assignments are very manageable and spaced out. The presentations are great for practicing not only Italian but public speaking in general. The final project (make and record your own radio show) is a blast.",

I didn't particularly love a lot of the songs but it was interesting to see how the music reflects changes in Italy - you'll be more cultured because of it! There wasn't that much work in the course, just a few short writing assignments and presentations. All in all, this course will definitely help you improve your proficiency and is an easy way to balance your other classes."

Having said that, the workload is heavy (we had online assignments almost every day, one or two quizzes per week, and take home assignments, which were longer assignments for the weekend, every once in a while) and the class gets harder as the semesters advances.

The workload is pretty consistent, and it's super important not to fall behind because there is reading homework, blogs (writing/speaking assignment), projects, and exams. However, I think this class really helped me improve my French and also understand French culture. The projects can be very time-consuming, so you should definitely get started pretty quickly so that you don't end up rushing at the end.

Occasionally you can find the movies on Amazon Prime, Netflix, or online but might have to pay to rent them. In general, most of the movies are interesting to watch"

Whatever your interests are, art, history, sports, politics, Catalan studies can satisfy your needs. Also, we went as a class on a cultural trip to Barcelona during winter break, funded by a generous donor. It was a really cool experience: the Catalans were incredibly thankful we learned their language, the city is a living museum, the nightlife is wild, the food is tasty and cheap, the weather is perfectly balanced Mediterranean. Catalonia is an amazing place to travel to and I am considering moving there at some point."

The workload is very low, but you definitely do learn from the course because Gus makes class meetings worthwhile. You can probably get away with skipping readings or skimming them, and in fact that's a skill I feel like I learned (how to read academic papers quickly, focusing on the results/conclusions, etc.), but the readings as a whole were interesting and mostly good reads. Readings also aren't that long so it's not like you'll be desperately up late into the night before class trying to finish them.",
      "This is a great class. Gus shows the most important quality in any good teacher - he's always looking to learn a little something himself, and he's always looking to improve. Readings are not too much, but are still a thourough survey of the literature on conversation."

This course is an 8-hour commitment to work for the lab every week, with very little homework beyond these assignments. The experience can vary quite a bit by which project you are assigned and which grad student is your direct advisor. I highly recommend interviewing with a couple of them (and they are fantastic people!) to get a sense of what would be the best fit. Though not much time is spent with Professor Gilbert throughout the semester, they are great mentors to work with.",

Having in-person meetings with Professor Gilbert were really inspiring and allowed me to get to know him on a personal basis.

      "Buckholtz is by far the best professor I've had at Harvard. He genuinely cares about the students in the class, and it feels like you actually learn something meaningful in the class. He has a ton of hands-on experience in the field and honestly tells the best stories. The workload for this class is pretty light -- A few readings each week that you discuss in class (students lead the conversation) & 2-page response papers every week. As long as you actually participate in the discussion, there's really no concern with grades. I think not having the constant pressure of grades/exams made me engage with the course material much more. I wasn't afraid to ask questions when they came up -- There are general themes for each week, but they aren't very strict. You can ask about anything that interests you. 100% recommend. You get out what you put into the class.",
      "Great discussions, interesting readings, lots of enthusiasm, the readings and topics were given out in a structure that made sense since the topic every week seemed to build on the last one. Also Buckholtz is literally a god and the greatest human being and teacher. Chill vibes all around"

I understand so much more about the actual process of research in a lab and have benefitted from learning about the recent topics in developmental psychology from some of the most intelligent and talented researchers in the field. Even if you are not sure if research is something you will like (I didn't feel very interested in research before taking this lab course) you can learn a lot about your own interests as well as some very important and practical skills which will be useful in the long run. In all when given the choice between a typical course about research methods and really getting to dive in and experience what these methods are like in practice, I would take the second option all the way! Not to mention the researchers and lab manager are all amazing people, I have loved getting to know everyone in the Spelke lab over the last year."

She knows what's relevant to people, and what they want to study, and even changes the content sometimes depending on what people want to learn. I'm not much of a nerd, and don't normally do work if I can get away with it, but even though you could get through class most of the time without doing the reading (a lot of the studies discussed in class are similar topics but different from the assigned readings), I found myself reading them the majority of the time because they were interesting. The reading workload is also not that heavy, so it's definitely doable. The assignments are also pretty fun, in the sense that you have pretty much free reign to write about whatever social movement you want, and can find some nice, obscure ones that are interesting.

      "The scale in the q guide is peculiar in that on one extreme, one can “definitely not recommend”, and on the other, “recommend with enthusiasm”. I do not recommend, do so with an abundance of grim enthusiasm. But if you are reading this, you are forced to take this class, so reader, persist, persevere, and take other classes to learn these methods well next year. And take care of yourself-- life is short, and this class is not the measure of the scholar you will be. In practical terms, take a unit of \"Time\" if you are able. This course had the potential to be something unique, useful. and even transformative— a substantial amount of content was presented across a variety of topics, with the opportunity to apply the material and strengthen skills in R. Some elements of the course were improved from part A— the slides and labs had fewer errors. Otherwise, this semester (with the notable exception of the excellent econometrics unit) was consistent with A in its a) lack of pedagogical vision, b) lack of review and reflection on the aims and materials provided to complete some labs, c) inconsistent tone of exams (is the desired answer straightforward (econ) or intentionally deceptive (exams 1 and 3). In a course where many students had postgraduate degrees in biostats and/or epi, the average grade for the first exam was a D. One frustrating continued theme is that the response of the course has been that the material is intended to be difficult and rigorous: the students largely support a challenging class with depth and breadth, but in future years adequate support, teaching materials, clear communication of aims, and pedagogical vision and planning should be implemented to ensure that there is a viable path (other than taking other courses previously) to meeting these aims. In particular, I would recommend the following: 1) The exams should be tested for clarity and mistakes prior to their release. An abundance of corrections as in quiz 3 is not acceptable. 2) Code should be tested to ensure it runs correctly, and is adequate to complete psets with ?help 3) When errors are found in lecture slides, the title should be updated so students know if the slides they printed are correct or not 4) One session should be devoted to going over the exam, and the rubric should be transparent 5) The course should clearly define which material and at what level will be included on the exam. This happened in theory, but in practice what were told did not match the exam 6) More support in r should be given, and teaching staff should be willing to look over code to help troubleshoot after reasonable effort and intent has been demonstrated 7) The professors should look over the homework. When students had questions, there was confusion about what had been assigned. More generally, the professors should work more closely with the teaching staff.",
      "This is an excellent course that will provide an overview of several important topics in epidemiology and econometrics. It is challenging, and sometimes frustrating, but you will gain an appreciation for the various methods which will allow you to decide which areas you want to take more coursework in later"

Roxanne did a good job of making material that can sometimes be intimidating feel accessible, and I left feeling that I had a pretty strong grasp of the basics of particle physics. If you're at all interested in particle physics, then I would definitely recommend this course.",
      "This was a great course, and if Roxanne Guenette is teaching it again I would definitely recommend it. It is a nice mix of theoretical and experimental and the general class atmosphere is pleasantly relaxed."

      "This class does not contain much mathematical rigor. It is also very important that you go to class, even if in the beginning class seems trivial; I am reasonably certain that by attending class you can get away with not reading the book, but if you skip class you will have to suffer through Townsend to learn the material/do the psets. At least from a mathematical perspective most of the time the problem sets are neither interesting nor enlightening, but certainly they force you to learn to do problems with/about quantum mechanics. It is also advisable that you do the psets after actually learning the material well rather than haphazardly finish the pset without a thorough understanding, as otherwise you end up having to learn the stuff anyway two nights before the exams. It turns out this is feasible, but it certainly is sub-optimal.",
      "Reece is a great professor who knows his stuff and you should definitely learn from if given the opportunity. The class is challenging but also really cool, this is like the first time that you get to study \"higher level physics\" stuff which is exciting and makes the class very worthwhile."

Homework goes from quite easy to manageable to very difficult as the semester progresses however, and the textbook is not very good at all (which is disappointing because most problems are from the text). This is a good class if you want that physics seminar experience and some practice with independent thought on the level that is necessary for research framing and publication, but the course is not very cohesive."

      "Phil 8 is a wonderful introductory philosophy class with great interesting philosophers and an amazing staff. Professor Simmons is an extremely knowledgeable and thoughtful lecturer who is willing to answer students' questions during lecture. These Q&A interactions makes class more engaging and help to clarify common concerns of students. Cat, my TF, was the best - she made section super fun and informative and provided very helpful feedback on written assignments and preparing for the final. Every Friday morning, we would be greeted with Starbucks coffee and Cat's humor in section, which made philosophy all the more fun to learn. The written assignments were thought-provoking, yet not too long and tedious. And the final exam was a synthesis of putting philosophers together in conversation, which was a great way to wrap up all we learned. Although it may be difficult to stay on top of readings, doing so will make lecture and section more valuable and engaging (you can generally listen to lectures without doing the reading, but you won't get as much out of them). Personally, Phil 8 has encouraged me to think and discuss philosophy more in my free time, which has enriched my life. Overall, reading philosophers and writing about them can get challenging, but the experience will transform the way you think and the way you view the world.",

      "This is a hard class. The material is fascinating when you take a step back – Godel's methods are really clever and the results are surprising. Sometimes the work feels overly fussy/in the weeds, which distracts from how cool the material is at a high level. The psets/exams are hard and require more than just time – you need to have a mathematical creativity in order to make any progress. I don't regret having taken the class – it forced me think hard and taught me about mathematical logic – but it wasn't smooth sailing throughout the semester.",
      "This class is especially difficult in that: 1) If you've formulated a good question, you already know what you're doing. (and the contrapositive) 2) If you don't know what you're doing, you'll ask bad questions. As someone who only took EMR17 in his first semester of freshman year, this class doesn't really require that much of a background in logic. More than anything, you need the ability to perform rather amazing feats of mental gymnastics, and you can train that, or at least the relevant form of it, in other highly abstract quantitative classes."

If you just want to go to Panama for a week over spring break, I would probably still lottery for this class but just be wary. There is a ton of material, a long weekly lab (including scores of sketches), and overall a lot more to this class than the Panama trip. With that being said, if you think you will enjoy the material, the Panama trip was the perfect compliment to everything we studied in class and truly helped me understand the material. I also loved this class for its small size. I think there were 14 of us, and we all became decent friends over the course of the semester. In short, be ready for tardigrades, ctenophores, and dozens of worms, but also know that this class rocks."

Most of the class is spent criticizing the papers we read (even though most are published in very prestigious journals). For this reason, the grad students talk the most because they have the most lab experience and it can be intimidating as an undergraduate to make comments in class. The midterm and final assignments can be annoying - they want you to synthesize the literature on each topic in like 3 paragraphs, which is a lot to ask - but they are graded generously."

      "The class is quite fun, but could be organized better. Lectures can be slow at times. Take it if you're interested. As far as a decision between this and herps: I think a non-bio concentrator will have an easier time in Herps. I also think you will find it more interesting, and find the field trip more fun. That being said, I really enjoyed this class overall. Keep in mind, I am an OEB concentrator with a background in this kind of stuff. As far as preparation goes for the assignments, be sure to write down all the studies you read. They will be heavily emphasized on the assessments. The assessments can be nitpicky so be sure to study the specifics.",
      "Take this class whether or not you already like/love birds! It's a relatively low workload but you learn a lot about bird diversity and biology, and the field trips (especially the spring trip) are a ton of fun. You also get to know your fellow students really well because of all the field trips during the semester, and everyone ends up being huge bird nerds! Getting to work with specimens in the bird collections every week in lab is also a huge treat, and the teaching staff are super friendly and knowledgeable! The course really gives you a greater appreciation for bird diversity and biology, so if any of that is even remotely interesting to you, definitely take this course!"

The TFs are super supportive and great at being available and adjusting the course as per students' needs. It's a shame Jonathan likely won't be teaching it in the future. One note as an aside: the spring break field trip is not fun. It is work. I personally didn't enjoy it immensely, but still am glad I did it and learned a lot. It's great for getting exposure to field biology, particularly in the tropics. However, do not take the course for the field trip. If that's your only motivation, you will be miserable for a week. But, if you like the tropics, herps, and being outside doing field work, it might be the most fun week ever.",

Although the format was almost entirely lecture-based, we often interrupted lectures to ask questions or hold informal discussions of various aspects of the presentation. The final paper is a very large assignment and is conducted almost completely independently (although both professors are readily available for help if so desired), so be sure to start early and discuss your topic ideas with both professors before beginning! This course provided an incredible opportunity to discuss two of the most fascinating and complex empires of the Ancient World - don't miss out on the chance to take this!",

While a comparison of the Sumerian Ur III dynasty and the Inka Empire may not seem obvious to some at first, a compelling case for doing so was made at the start, which was proved true over the duration of the course. Overall, the course is both provoking and enjoyable--thus, well worth future consideration."

      "This class is truly amazing if you go into it with your full attention. I'd never imagine I'd be analyzing Beyonce in relation to programmatic analyses of Beethoven, discussions on format, hip-hop, genre, rhythmic teleology, and many more. This class does go fast (it is necessary). Each week you have a substantial amount of reading with an accompanying audio/visual for which you write a page or two response paper (by Sunday). Monday is lecture, Wednesday you go over lecture in section, and Friday you discuss more in-depth of new questions and relations to previous themes. You learn a lot in lecture, but be prepared to get cold-called on very heavy questions (such as what is teleology) and be expected to answer. However, as long as you show you did the readings and gave it your best shot, Prof. Shelley won't be angry - he wants to jumpstart this discussion. At some points, class seemed a little unprepared, but I expect that to change with Prof. Shelley now having his first year of the course completed. Being a musician/understanding music is extremely helpful, but not required. Take this course!",

      "A highly inspiring seminar with a lot of fascinating readings and many hours of in-class discussion. The seminar is very interactive, and it gives you the opportunity to develop your own project (no constraints in topics and methods!) and offers guidance to help create your project, including a final presentation and a paper form. This seminar definitely is a great opportunity to write a conference paper that can be used afterwards elsewhere (submitted to conferences, etc.) I liked this seminar particularly because of its interdisciplinary character not only in the topics discussed, but this was also reflected in the student population: scholars from different fields (humanities and even sciences), musicians, artist. This was wonderful!",

I now am fluent with the language of opera and feel a lot more knowledgeable watching or playing an opera. From a time point of view, this class was very manageable, but this is not to take away from the complexity of the material. For me, a relatively new person to the field of opera, finding a way to effectively listen to these operas and read about them took some time, but I eventually found a way. John Hamilton and Fed are two of the smartest professors on this campus and boy, when you combine music and literature, you truly get something beautiful.",

RCS is not just a choir; it's a family that will provide you with loving friends and role models who run this 510c3 incredibly well. What's best is that whether you have tons of singing experience or zero at all, we welcome you to audition and give the group a shot. If you are a member of one of the choruses, you can get subsidized voice lessons as well, so if you feel shaky on your singing, that's just another reason to audition!

Andy Clark is one of the nicest and most inspiring people I have encountered on campus, and it is a total joy to spend 4.5 hours every week with this group. If you have any interest in music whatsoever, I highly encourage that you audition!",
      "Collegium is amazing! The best choice I made this year was to join Collegium: this group has not only given me lots of great musical experiences, but also a family at Harvard."

      "MCB 68 provides an amazing hands-on method to learning cell biology! Instead of simply reading about various cell structures, you'll get to collect samples and image these structures yourself. In addition, you learn how to operate microscopes of varying complexity, including very fancy (and expensive) microscopes in the Harvard Center for Biological Imaging. There is a quiz every class starting in about the third week, and these mostly consist of rote memorization based on the material from the previous week's lecture. The assignment guidelines for the two independent projects (especially the corresponding lab notebooks) tended to be a bit unclear, so be sure to clarify these assignments if necessary. I personally found the biology lectures to be a bit tedious and dry but loved the microscopy lectures, but other students felt the opposite, so if you have even a slight interest in both topics, you'll really like this course!"

There's not really a deep dive into any of them, but you meet some cool guest lecturers who you can talk to later if you're interested. There's also a final proposal that definitely can creep up on you if you don't pace yourself, so start early! The class is an interesting one, though it sometimes feels disjointed as it's just a different guest lecturer each time. However, our TF this year was really good at making sure to remind everyone about overall course deadlines and providing feedback on our work. The only work in this class behind the final proposal (and preceding submissions) is just reading the two papers and coming into class prepared."

While I still was able to perform well in the class because of the style of assessment, it was difficult to engage with the material (because of the number of lecturers). However, it's still incredible getting to talk with researchers who are at the top of their fields, and who have made some of the most incredible breakthoughs in genetics.

      "This course gives a sort of overarching, example-based introduction to the theory of schemes. As always, Professor Harris is a wonderful lecturer and provides fantastic intuition and a large breadth of examples, as well as a good introduction to sheaf cohomology. That being said, one should know that sometimes proofs or justifications are very quick or somewhat hazy for certain details, often out of necessity due to the hairiness of certain proofs. Most importantly, I felt very lost in certain parts of the course because I didn't have a very firm geometric intuition for concepts like twisted cubics, complete intersections, and other staples of the classical theory. I would strongly recommend not just knowing what they are (like I did), but actually playing around with them a bit for taking this course. In particular, this class isn't a normal introduction to schemes, like what you would get from Vakil or Hartshorne. It's more narrow and more algebraic Geometry rather than Algebraic geometry."

      "Amazing content, taught by a real master. Gaitsgory was always fun, charming, entertaining, and a pleasure to be taught by. That said, he has his own style, which is a blessing and a curse. To me, the abstraction of Professor Gaitsgory’s treatment of the material was at times too much -- this was my first experience with someone this Professor Gaitsgory, and his reputation for abstract, category-theoretic reasoning, is really deserved! I spent a lot of time trying to parse the meaning/setup of the theory in class, and sometimes just got hopelessly bogged down. I felt most comfortable with the material after I read Springer's book on Algebraic Groups independently towards the end of class. There were other times (perhaps because I came in with the least background — many graduate students studying with Professor Gaitsgory were taking the class, too) — where the detailed setup of the theory was skipped in favor of giving more time to advanced stuff. Gaitsgory would try to supplement this in office hours, but even there I felt like some of the rudiments were being avoided (I was sent to the Stacks Project to learn a few of the background bits of algebraic geometry). The result was that I often felt like I was woefully unprepared to take the class, when in reality, I was far closer than I thought (as I found out at the end when I started reading Springer to be able to do my final project). If someone knows Math 222 (Lie theory up to the ADE classification, root systems, Cartan subalgebras, etc.), along with the basics of scheme theory (Chevalley’s theorem, existence of fiber products, and basics of completeness and properness), then they are essentially prepared — though obviously the more algebraic geometry one knows, the better. Springer (the textbook — “Linear Algebraic Groups”) is great -- a little dated (it is not fully consumed by the language of scheme theory; though that is more a question of cosmetic appearance than of actual content). It seems Milne offers a textbook that is a little more modern, although there is literally no reference on Earth that i as abstract as Gaitsgory, who introduced Ind-Schemes in the second class — something which cannot be found in any of the classic textbooks on the subject. My recommendation is to not care if that kind of stuff is weird or obscure, or to talk to Professor Gaitsgory in office hours about it. The actual meat of the theory can be found in Springer. But overall, the class was a hoot. Great fun, and very informative. Read Springer to understand the material, but enjoy the sheer entertainment of Gaitsgory’s lectures, and bask in the categorical nature of Gaitsgory’s abstract mind!"

      "Professor Yau is a consummate master of this material. It was a fairly ambitious curriculum, and Prof. Yau taught it in a (for the most part) very motivated, historically-minded way. The fact that classes were recorded was invaluable; one could rewatch lectures on canvas (and see lectures one might have missed — of which, I confess, I was very guilty, since the class tended to meet in a rather distant part of campus by the quad — not in the science center — at 10 AM). The books Professor Yau urged us to read on the side — namely, Griffiths/Harris's \"Principles of Algebraic Geometry,\" Siegel's \"Topics in Complex Function theory\" and Hermann Weyl's \"Concept of a Riemann Surface\" were an incredibly useful in addition to the text, Farkas/Kra's \"Riemann Surfaces.\" Siegel’s book, in particular, is a forgotten masterpiece. I might also suggest for someone taking this class to supplement with Donaldson's book, \"Riemann Surfaces,\" which for me added an extremely helpful additional reference. At times, since the material covered was so broad in scope, and because time was so limited, Professor Yau seemed to be giving more of an overview of the content, leaving out many crucial details. He did not introduce sheaf cohomology, for instance — instead, he urged us to read about the details in compendious books like Griffiths/Harris \"Principles of Algebraic Geometry.\" Moreover, the homework was never written down in a centralized form -- we had to rewatch lectures of the class to find out what problems we were assigned. These were mentioned haphazardly throughout the lecture. (In some ways, however, being forced to rewatch the material was helpful.) Moreover, some concepts were introduced — curvature, various metrics on complex manifolds (Fubini-Study, Bergman, Kobayashi, etc.), for example — without as much motivation as I would have liked. Kahler forms were discussed in the background but never formally introduced, so a good deal of piecing-together was necessary on the part of the student. Some of the arguments were almost complete (for example he gave a detailed outline of the proof that every Riemann surface admits a conformal metric of curvature -1). I’d say that this class requires a good amount of mathematical maturity. Exams and homeworks were not unreasonably difficult, however. Among undergraduates at Harvard, there seems to be something of a fear of taking Professor Yau’s classes — perhaps because of an expectation that the courses will be too difficult or intense. Having taken this class, I can say with confidence that this is wrongheaded — Professor Yau is extremely kind, and was very clear throughout the course. It seems one can hardly learn this content from someone better, so be unafraid should Professor Yau teach this class in the future!"

      "This semester, Prof. Siu taught a course on partial differential equations. The course was very hard and time-consuming. There were hard problem sets and lots of papers to read on top of lecture. At several moments in the semester, I felt quite burnt out. But looking back, the course was incredibly worth it. Prof. Siu is very good at distilling the key ideas and methods of hard and general techniques and presenting them so that they almost feel easy. We covered a great variety of material, from the Nash-Moser implicit function theorem to the Bernstein-Sato method of solution to general constant coefficient PDE. Prof. Siu plowed a path of intuition through the tedium of estimates and manipulations which often overtakes textbooks in PDE. I also feel that this course has given me a new perspective on a lot of seemingly unrelated mathematics. For instance, this course let me understand Hormander's viewpoint on symplectic geometry. Basically, differential equations underlie our universe. They're the source of a lot of beautiful mathematics. If you're checking out this course, clear the rest of your calendar and take it!"

Honestly, I found the final project more helpful in learning than the exams because you could choose your own topic of interest and connect what you've learned in class to something people might do in their jobs day to day.

      "Brooke teaches well and is attentive to students. I however, didn't end up liking the material. This class was based on Fulton's Algebraic Curves. We got to ~ chapter 5. I took this class because I didn't know anything about this major branch of mathematics, and I came away thoroughly bored. Few to none of the concepts were challenging or exciting and I found myself constantly wondering \"why should I care about plane curves???\". I understand that real algebraic geometry may be very far from what we were doing because we were developing the basic theory. You should just zoom through Fulton on your own and then pick up a more exciting book."

In light of that, taking Math 129 with professor Mazur is perhaps the most wonderful way of getting a familiarity with the subject. In particular, he lectures with great clarity, and makes deep, often difficult things to prove seem effortless and natural. If Mazur teaches this course again, it is a must take.",

To get anything out of this course you need to seriously devote the time to making sure you are understanding at every stage (for me this was doing all the reading carefully and attending all sections and office hours).

Class more or less follows (and is at times identical to) Artin's presentation of quadratic number fields and Galois theory; however, at times Professor Kisin's proofs/presentations deviate from the path taken in Artin. Although I did not read Artin very much (read as: at all), I imagine it is very helpful. Exams tend to be either calculation problems or repeats of homework problems. The stated prerequisite is Math 122. Although Math 55a supposedly works too, in reality Math 55a (or at least Professor Elkies's version), as good of a class as it is, doesn't really adequately prepare you for algebra in general; for example, we didn't really know any group theory.",

My language skills improved more than any other semester of ASL. It moves beyond learning vocab and grammar to the more nuanced aspects of ASL (role shift, mouth shape and movement as grammar, etc.) and you learn how to express ideas so much more clearly. A lot of the course was also spent on improving reception and expression. Felt a lot more comfortable telling stories about my life and anecdotes, which is a big cultural thing in the Deaf community. The ASL literature and Deaf Culture stuff we learned was awesome too :) sad there's not ASL 5 and 6 at Harvard... felt like I was just starting to become more fluent this semester.",

If you have already taken ASL I with Anbo, one thing to know is that ASL II picks up a lot more. There is so much more vocabulary to cover, and it will be really important for you to stay strictly up to date with the workbook. There are also more assignments added in like bi-weekly video journals, so a lot more videos to do, and the exams begin to be in a slightly different format (on the final, for example, we watched videos of Anbo signing and responded in class to them through video recordings).

      "This fantastic course represents a continuation of the first semester's introduction to seminal works of the humanities, working through incredible texts from the present (Joyce's Ulysses) to the past (Homer's Iliad). I'd highly recommend the class and believe it is one of the best opportunities for academic growth available to freshman, but this is contingent upon a willingness to invest yourself fully in the work. You won't get nearly as much out of the course without completing the reading assignments in a timely manner and thoughtfully engaging with the writing projects. The course provides a platform for intellectual transformation, but you must commit to the intensity of the experience."

I am very impressed with the subject material and the course staff's ability to appropriately capture the discussion between scholarly work, current events and historical events. Definitely one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard- I will refer back to what I learned in this class often, I am sure.",

      "This is an excellent course. The professor is incredibly knowledgeable and has really profound things to share so being in a seminar with her is an amazing opportunity. The material is, of course, very difficult in an emotional sense. Reading all of the readings at once can certainly put you in a cynical or generally upset mood since this class really shows you the worst parts of humanity throughout history. But every topic is handled with incredible care. Also, the assignments are quite straightforward in this class since essentially you just take on a large project/essay about any topic you are personally interested in related to trauma so there is so much flexibility to explore a topic that means a lot to you. You really learn so much and it gives you a new perspective when understanding contemporary discourse in psychology an psychiatry. Overall, amazing course and one of the best I've taken at Harvard."

The lectures are unorganized and often times devolve into tangents. Some of the readings don't line up at all with the lectures and but are on the final so read them with friends. Not a lot of people attended lecture so rather than taking attendance, the lecturers made the final harder to punish everyone so that wasn't great. This class requires a lot of patience but is worth it if you want a general survey in art history. There aren't many other options and the lecturers are trying really hard to make this class better, which will hopefully be the case.",

      "As a disclaimer, Professor B. is a very kind, talented professor who I believe was experiencing some personal difficulties and could not devote herself as much to the course as she would have liked. That being said, I did not enjoy this course because of the class atmosphere. It was discussion-based and students had very little respect for each other. Everyone was constantly looking to prove that they had the right analysis and were at the ready to attack other students. While the class texts were good, our critiques often went beyond the point of \"deconstruction\" where we ripped texts to shred so much I wondered why we even bothered reading them. Unfortunately one of the only things I got out of the class was \"what not to do\" when writing under the umbrella of post-colonial studies or anthropology. I imagine there was supposed to be more to it than that. I think that the main reason I did not enjoy this course was how students treated each other but perhaps that would be a non-issue with a new iteration of the course.",

      "This course will give you a whole new appreciation for museums. Between the readings and the visits to various nearby institutions, you learn so much about their history and place in American society and culture. There is a good amount of reading for each week, but it is not all academic writing which helps to make it feel more balanced. The small class size leads to some really fascinating discussion. I would highly recommend this course!",
      "I cannot speak to this as a Hist & Lit requirement, but it is a fantastic choice of elective, as it will help you think about the specific history and issues of museums as part of broader social, political, and cultural frameworks. The reading load is moderate, and I survived well doing at least 2/3 of the reading each week, although I can imagine getting by decently by doing less than that on rough weeks. However, I wouldn't recommend missing out on the material, as it helped me think a lot more critically about many of the institutions I've grown up loving. Not just negatively, either: Dr. Gochberg includes plenty of material critical of colonialist and nationalistic museum collecting, but she also helps you understand how and why various types of museums have come into fruition. The assignments are very manageable, and the final project gives you a lot of freedom to explore. I especially like the options to design your own syllabus unit or museum collection; these interesting assignments, along with the several museum visits, helped to keep a potentially boring course quite fresh and exciting."

If you have absolutely no interest in this subject, it's probably not a good fit. But if you find the idea at all intriguing, it's an engaging way to learn some really cool stuff. Definitely not a course you could just learn on YouTube or from buying a book, feels really like a unique Harvard experience. Professor Gilsdorf does tend to dominate the conversation and have a specific idea of where he wants the conversation to go, so you have to be willing to speak up and sometimes have him disagree with you. The paper is pretty independent so if this is your first research paper experience it may not be the best option, but it's a comparably short paper so don't feel intimidated.",

I would only recommend taking this class if you are truly interested in the subject matter, because I would imagine that if not it would be difficult to spend an entire semester on this pretty niche subject. I very much enjoyed it, though. The final project is a great way to research something you are interested in and have a chance to present at an academic conference."

The readings can be very dull and a little unrelated to the course/your own research for your final paper, but the way the course is structured is great... you basically work in stages toward your final paper. The periodic revisions definitely help you realize your shortcomings as a writer and learn from them.",
      "This is a wonderful class! I never realized that I was interested in Social History until I took this class, and now I think this is the type of history that I would be interested in specializing in. Professor Chalhoub is wonderful--he is really understanding and strives to make students comfortable even from the first class (I was pretty nervous that this would be a scary and intimidating experience, for some reason). He also shed lots of light on his personal decision to be a historian, and the awesome parts of history and historical research. I feel like I got a lot from this class, even beyond the class's strict purpose of teaching students to write a great history paper. This class allowed me to do original historical research that involved interviewing my parents about their experiences in the Cambodian genocide, something I didn't think would be possible so early on--Harvard has basically zero resources re: Southeast Asia, and it's just so incredible that Hist 97 allows you to pick your own topic for your final research paper and that your professor and TF will provide you with amazing support on the path there. James was also an incredible TF! I contacted him for last minute help pretty frequently, and he was always willing to meet. He took a personal interest in all of our papers, and provided super helpful and specific advice. He definitely took the time to make sure that we got the help we needed to improve writing-wise as well as to do as well on and learn from our research papers."

      "This was the worst class I have taken at Harvard. The TFs are grad students who are not looking to make your experience in this class enjoyable. Expect them to grade harshly, nitpick at the implications of small words, and quite possibly even question your character. The key to getting good grades in this class is to argue the most liberal viewpoint possible in order to please the self-proclaimed communist TF and the uber liberal professor. This class taught me very little about history, and a lot about how much the history department at this school blows. In fact, the course evals will be misleading because 1/4 of the class dropped the concentration in the first two weeks. In addition to an egregious incident with a TF that I had to bring to the attention of the course head (who I might add is a great resource, and is not at fault in any of this), the professor was insincere with me as well. A 10 page paper was due on Sunday at 5pm. On Thursday, I went in to her office and told her how sick I was (and it was obvious as I was coughing constantly, had a fever of 102, and was losing my voice). Despite my sickness, she told me to scratch my 10 page draft and write on a whole new topic. And I quote \"you might have to pull a couple all-nighters to get it done in time, but I hope you have fun writing!\"",
      "Of the History 97 options, I'd recommend this one, but History 97 overall has serious structural issues. The tutorial part of 97 is really useful for developing history writing skills, and working closely with a TF on your research project is rewarding. But the seminar component is scattered and incoherent - the readings are not helpful for individual writing projects, and \"urban history\" is too broad a topic for a seminar that only meets every other week at most."

Know that this requires serious work (at least 1 book read + 1 response paper every week, plus an end-of-term paper + presentation). The class itself demands active participation, and the professor regularly \"cold-calls\" throughout class. This ensures a high level of preparation and an engaging conversation, but be warned: if you're willing to put in the time, you get a lot out. If not, this is not the class for you."

      "This course has been one of my favorite at Harvard. I am an Economics concentrator, and as such, I have approached the topic of \"American capitalism\" repeatedly throughout my classes albeit indirectly. In the Economics department, its taught as the way markets should operate and capitalism is defacto the market designs we study: supply=demand, profit maximization by monopolies, government regulation. What the department lacks is a grander context: How did this type of market design come to be? What have been its flaws and strengths over the last few centuries as it pertains to the US? What do laissez faire or Keynesian polices look like in terms of inequality? Its these types of perspective broadening questions that you get to dive into in this course. Professor Beckert is a phenomenal lecturer with meticulously prepared notes behind every class discussion, blending brilliantly together fun historical tidbits within overarching historical themes. The section leaders are also remarkable, in particular my TF Rachel Steely. Sections are designed to go over reading take-aways and situate texts into the grander historical picture laid out in lecture. After a semester, I felt like I have walked away with a grander appreciation for the courses Ive taken in the Econ department, and the institutions we take as a matter of fact. Thank you for leading a perspective changing course"

Professor Martin is a really fascinating lecturer, the workload and assignments are manageable and reasonably graded, and you learn A LOT about the period and its people in a relatively short amount of time.

There was a great variety of assignments and we got to practice presentation skills throughout the semester (in a way that challenges you but doesn't scare you). The 30-pager is kind of brutal, but Dr. Park empowers you to work hard on it. Dr. Park truly cares about his students - he may come off as very formal at first, but is a really friendly guy and wants to facilitate the formation of a class bond. He took us out to Tasty Burger for a class dinner at the start and end of the semester. He actually incorporated class's advice after our mid-course evaluation. He's also very encouraging, which is nice in a class with complicated and constantly evolving material and a huuuuge paper.

I came in the class feeling very intimidated by political theory but now I committed to writing a senior thesis on political theory. I highly recommend this for anyone trying to start a thesis, as you will learn the fundamentals and get started on it as graded components of the course. I can’t recommend the course any more!",

      "This course opened my eyes to a variety of fascinating and very useful approaches to studying different questions in international relations -- it enables one to advance one's command of both theory as well as of cutting-edge methods from fields other than just political science. In terms of the breadth of the surveyed literature, this is quite possibly the most comprehensive Government course offered by the Department: The recommended readings section for each week is as detailed or perhaps even more detailed than published review essays on the topics in question would be. Additionally, the depth of the survey does not suffer in the least (despite the broad range of topics covered). The assignments are also extremely educational for budding academics, and, while challenging, are great fun, which is not something that can easily be said for graded work! Namely, the peer-review exercise was one of my favorite class assignments so far, as it helped me better understand the dynamics behind the otherwise somewhat forbidding prospect of facing peer review in a real-world (well, academic journal) setting. Perhaps even more importantly, it demonstrated that the peer review world is not (as realism would likely have it) a \"homo homini lupus\" world: The status quo appears to in large part be the product of a certain kind of path-dependent socialization. Fortunately, however -- at least in the present student's opinion -- the results of said socialization can slowly be reversed if more graduate seminars start to include peer review exercises like this one. With the emergence of clusters of students who have undergone this process, it is perhaps not too foolhardy to hope that \"nice\" reviewing will turn out to be a collectively stable strategy! Finally, Professor Kertzer is an outstanding teacher, not only steering seminar discussions with expertise and care but also providing a stream of personalized feedback to each student over the course of the semester. This makes writing a paper of publishable quality much less daunting.",

It was usually okay if I was able to do the readings before lecture, but that isn't always possible. I think if I had more background on the region I would have enjoyed the course more. If you're just curious about the region but don't know its history, it might be better to take a different course. If you're more familiar with it and want a really awesome dive into political theory about the region then this is a great course."

You will be allowed to explore and develop your own ideas in response to the argument of the course in a very open fashion, and the lectures/sections were incredibly engaging, fun, and thought-provoking. Also, Unger is one of the few thinkers I've encountered at this university with a sprawling, all-encompassing philosophy (from time to ethics to politics) that is truly unique. You should be ready to engage with this course by having a willingness to reconsider why our politics, economies, etc. are arranged the way they are. Unger will not force you to accept his view, but you must be ready to either defend or reject the ideas he raises. In addition, you must be willing (and should probably be excited) to consider your own worldview in response to the arguments of the course. This is not a course where you can just passively analyze some arguments or exposite them, but rather you will actually be formulating ideas of your own and then arguing for them in response to some of the themes of the course. Basically, Unger allows you unlimited freedom to choose what you want to write about and the TF (Pete Davis) really encourages you to argue for something bold and exciting. tl;dr great class, should take it!",
      "Progressive Alternatives was my favorite class I've ever taken. This is in large part due to Pete, our excellent TF. I felt that this class truly made me think outside of the box and develop my world view. I recommend this class with enthusiasm to anyone interested in studying Gov or simply in taking a really cool class about progressivism. The class centers around Unger's theories but it also leaves ample room for students to think about their own ideas relative to Unger's. I felt I grew as a political thinker by taking this course."

Prof Harrison is incredibly knowledgeable about survey design — and through this course, you get to create your own ready-to-be-launched survey project with very valuable feedback and advice from an authority in the field. Moreover, you will learn about cutting-edge survey design and how students are incorporating these cool methods to their projects.100% recommend.

      "As someone who lotteried for this class three years in a row and was excited to finally get it, I would not recommend taking this class. It is highly overrated. The format of the course is modeled after the HBS Case Method which means 95% of the class is spent listening to other students rather than learning about China from the professor. Before each class you read a case that is usually not that insightful and then spend the entire class rehashing key figures that were explicitly in the reading. The first 15 minutes of class will be spent answering questions such as what year was this company founded?, what does it do?, who was the founder?. Essentially no time is devoted to discussing business strategy and things not explicitly written in the case. At HBS, this discussion is central to the case method. Here there is no real emphasis on independent thought. Students regurgitate figures from the cases and then frantically flip through the reading trying to answer basic follow-up questions rather than thinking for themselves. 40% of your grade is based on participation. This is frustrating because you can raise your hand for the entire class and only get called on for questions that have one word answers. Many people I know lost motivation and resigned themselves to not participating. Another 40% of your grade is in the form a group research project to create a case study on a Chinese company of your choice. This can either be good or bad. Just think about how much people despise group projects and know that 40% of your grade depends on it. There are occasional speakers, many of whom are very influential Chinese businessmen. However, only a few of the speakers (all of them American) offered anything of value. All of the Chinese businessmen basically said “our businesses are doing well; we will continue to do well”. The American speakers gave more insight and actually answered sensitive questions about the government. Overall, this class was a major disappointment. Professor Kirby is very intelligent and a great history lecturer. My favorite parts of the course were perhaps the cumulative 40 minutes he lectured on China. Unfortunately, he rarely lectures and spends most of his time asking questions about basic figures and then making witty comments. Some people seem to enjoy this class, but I think it was a waste of time. Just know that this class is potentially overrated and make sure you have a backup plan because shopping week is not indicative of the rest of the year.",
      "Ready the cases and articles (especially interesting) and make sure you participate in class (be alert). Book reports are also super interesting and make sure you reach out to Prof. Kirby and your TFs as you can learn a whole lot from them 1:1 too"

The class was my favorite I have taken as an undergraduate. The course is also run incredibly well run: All of the lectures and materials were very organized, and expectations of students were crystal clear. It is not a lot of work, but you should do the readings and pay attention in class; I promise it's worth it. After taking this course, I look at my identity and interactions with other people in totally new ways. This class will give you a \"toolbox\" of sorts with which to consider your everyday life--in addition to race, gender, and sexuality-- as a series of performances. This class also talks about performance as activism, and how to use performance to change the world for the better. This is the kind of class I'd hoped would be offered when choosing Harvard.

Professor Brown-Nagin is also extremely engaging and does a great job of stimulating class discussion and participation.",

The discussions will push you to think deeply and critically, and you will learn an enormous amount about legal history, the history of social movements, and the interplay between legal and non-legal tactics. The topics that this class covers of course have powerful connections to modern-day debates. While students might have been nervous to participate during the first couple of class sessions, we soon grew eager to comment on the reading assignments and respond to follow-up questions—and we learned a great deal as a result.

      "I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS CLASS HIGHLY ENOUGH. The teacher - Arthur - is the kind of rarely brilliant and exceptionally kind person who will better your intellect and character at the same time. The class is taught almost entirely through field trips and by guest lecturers. We met industry expert after industry expert and visited everywhere from the top story office of the Prudential Center, to the Boston Public Art Museum, to HBS and the Cambridge Public Library. For our final presentation, Arthur managed to have the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and the primary architects of a built city in Korea come and judge our presentations. This class was the highlight of my week and has made me even more certain that I want to study urban design in the future. A word about Tyler, the TF - you cannot find someone more engaged, hard working, and genuinely interested in his students. He gives fantastic life advice and cares an enormous amount about the quality of the seminar.",
      "Hands-down the best freshman seminar. Three-quarters of the classes are field trips, and almost every class there are amazingly influential guest speakers. Also, because so many people apply for this seminar, you get to meet a really diverse and fun group of fellow students! Arthur is incredibly well-connected, so for our midterm and final projects we presented to people like Shaun Donovan, who was Obama's Secretary of HUD. We also got to meet Yo-Yo Ma, just because. Arthur really wants to get to know each of his students as people, and is kind enough to invite everyone to dinner at his house. This class is a great way to expand your horizons and get interested in urban design. The readings are also great; Tyler, our TF, curates them."

Look forward to the last day--presenting your poster is really fun! Occasionally switch lab partners--get to know the other people in your seminar."

While listening to his \"lectures,\" which were more so him talking about the material while also being open to our own input at any time, I often felt like I was experiencing the epiphanies one might have in a philosophy class-- reconsidering the biological drive in both animals and humans was a truly intellectually vitalizing experience. The only work demanded of this class is to engage with brief yet fascinating readings. I ended up loving the subject matter of this seminar so much that I have decided it will be my lifelong research passion (marine bioacoustics). By all means, if you are considering this seminar, please do take it-- if not for the chance to get to know one of Harvard's best faculty members (ask him to show you the Rockefeller Beetle Collection! He is the Museum of Comparative Zoology's entomologist), then for the engaging academic conversations and experiences, such as a lovely field trip to Middlesex Fells for some bird-watching and -listening."

The class doesn't meet for class during the week and instead consists of four weekend field trips led by a team of passionate professors who have dedicated their lives to the study of global change ecology. With three trips to the Harvard Forest and one to the beaches of Martha's Vineyard, there is not a more exciting experiential course available to freshman students! If you have even a slight interest, I highly recommend you lottery for the course--and it is important that you preference it as your number-one option if you want a chance at getting in. If selected, doing the readings and engaging with the assignments really enhances the experience of the excursions.",

      "The Eating Culture section of Expos is an ethnography class. It is surprisingly difficult to find things to say about food. In my opinion the most difficult essay is the second one, which requires you to analyze two cooking shows (which seems not applicable to most students' studies at large and therefore kinda pointless). The readings are, with a few exceptions, unpleasant. I think making attendance mandatory for Expos is unnecessary, as from what I can tell (at least for Eating Culture) we don't learn anything by going to class: we mostly regurgitate what we read in the readings to demonstrate that we did them. In full generality, I think making Expos mandatory for all freshmen is ill-advised, as the premise of a cover-all writing class applicable to all 1700 students simply seems preposterous to me."

It's clear that the three professors care about the class and put a lot of effort into preparing the curriculum and class sessions, and they really care about engaging students. I was already interested in the subject matter and the course challenged many of my assumptions and prior knowledge about elements of world food systems and changed my opinion on a lot of issues surrounding GMOs, organic foods, agribusiness practices, animal welfare, etc. It was an amazing experience to read HBS cases and then have Prof. Reinhardt lead discussion with our class and the CEOs/business executives we had just read about. Prof. Paarlberg played a big role in changing my perspective of the politics of food. Prof. Holbrook helped me understand the biological and scientific aspects of how we relate to the earth via food systems. A truly informative and engaging class — it was a highlight of my week.",

This course was very much discussion based though, so it really depends on people coming to class with interesting perspectives and ideas for it to be engaging, which we fortunately had, but might not always be the case.

      "This is a wonderful class. Josh is truly one of the kindest, warmest, and most supportive instructors I have ever met. The weekly group of assigned poems was always fascinating, and Josh does a great job of picking perhaps lesser-known poets alongside of some of the classics. The ability to get feedback from others on your writing is really helpful, and Josh's comments are always so in-depth and clearly reflect the care with which he approaches the class. If you want a supportive, nurturing environment within which to develop your confidence as a writer, this is the class for you."

      "Prof. Blum is amazing, and honestly may be one of the best professors I have had at Harvard. She is critical of students' comments, caring, and pays attention to how students feel about the books and the course which honestly special. The class was intimate and it was structured so that students truly received the most out of it. I am grateful to be chosen to take this class, and I loved how in the application, she didn't ask students about concentration, year, etc. Instead, she just asked you to explain why you wanted to take this class and I appreciate this because it really allowed students who were interested to get a fair shot in getting in, which is so unlike Harvard. This class was life changing, and I honestly regret that I didn't have more time this semester to devote to it. It doesn't take too much time each week, but it was such a pleasurable experience that I regret I couldn't engage even more. Each week as I was reading, I would constantly be talking about the books we read to my friends, and they would be so interested they would snatch the book from me to read a bit out of them.",
      "As a freshman who took this course as her first exposure to the English department, I was surprised, delighted, and challenged by this course all at once. Professor Blum is great — she’s incredibly knowledgeable, kind, and really cares about her students. The assignments are really fun, ranging from exploring a bookstore to creating a vlog to making connections between courses. The small class size (fewer than 15 students) is conducive to some really engaging and vibrant discussions surrounding the course texts, which, in themselves, are compelling reads. The workload is manageable -- I balanced it with two other heavy-reading, humanities courses. I learned new ways to analyze texts, and, more importantly, learned valuable critical thinking and writing skills. Above all, I learned about myself — during this course, I engaged in the very self-help we discussed in class, pushing myself to take new risks and try new things throughout the semester. At one point, I did not do as well as I wanted to on an assignment for this class, but I pushed myself to improve and scheduled some really helpful on-on-one meetings with Professor Blum, during which I learned so much about the nature of academic writing in the English department. In the end, I think I came out a better person because of this course. It challenged me to become a better writer and thinker and was the highlight of my week, especially during rough parts of the semester in which this class served as a coping mechanism. This class is a really great opportunity to get to know Professor Blum and learn more about her work in the self-help genre, all while working on your own self-improvement and developing life skills ranging from resilience to forgiveness to maturity to stronger writing and analysis. I definitely recommend this course!"

      "Professor Bhabha will push you to make a serious intellectual commitment in this class. Even though he is committed in his own work to theory, in his teaching he is most concerned with helping his students become theorists and thinkers themselves. This course will push you to think deeply about what concerns you, what moves you, what keeps you up at night, what strikes you in literature. Much of the course discussion is based in serious close reading of texts. If you want a survey, go somewhere else. If you want to spend 30 minutes looking at specific paragraphs, tearing apart their syntax, secret subject, their form, and their role in an auther's larger oeuvre and the history of narrative, take this course. This course pushed me to be a deeper and more creative thinker and reader. Thank you Professor Bhabha!",
      "There is a lot of reading for this course, so be prepared for that. The class largely depends on your classmates to direct the flow, and if they have more experience in areas outside your purview it's often difficult to catch up. The professor can often be difficult to follow, as he usually engages in a long and winding lecture to start off the class. Speaking up is essential but sometimes hard to do, as the prof seems to kind of judge the quality of your response. With that said, it is a very interesting course that does allow you to encounter a number of interesting works and authors, and if you have a strong interest in these topics, this may be a good course for you."

      "Carpio is a genius. Just speaking to her you can really tell how knowledgable she is. She doesn't teach you what you think you should know about gender and representation, she teaches you what you need to know to really truly understand how gender and representation works in our world today. The depth of concepts and the care with which she treats them makes every lecture a pleasure to sit through. Would highly recommend this and any course with her.",
      "This course is amazing and every student should take it. If you have any interest in how gender, race, and class very consequentially structure our lives and our world (or / especially if you're skeptical), or if you want a master class in how to use literature to understand practical and emotional realities, or if you want to work through race and gender theory with a professor who can explain it clearly and connect it to lots of compelling artistic sources, you should take this class! If not this course, any other with Professor Carpio will probably benefit you; she is amazing. If you're not a literature person and just need a lit course for whatever reason, this course is probably as relevant to real life as it gets -- the novels, short stories, art pieces, and other works we looked at in this course look far more compelling and important to everyday life and pressing social issues when studied in the context of this syllabus than I could have figured out on my own. Grading was a tiny bit harder than usual for the reading classes I've taken before, but not that hard, and there are only three short papers, so workload was light. The one downside to be prepared for is that almost all of the material on the syllabus is emotionally heavy. These books and other works are serious and intense and have some very upsetting content that will feel extremely important but also difficult to just casually read. Google the books/plays etc or read the blurb on the back before you start reading just so you know what might be upsetting in it for you. Absolutely worth it though. I loved this course and wish it were a gen ed / wish way more people would take courses like this when they are this amazingly well done."

I loved designing and building our own robot completely from scratch. I will say that having 4 different assignments to keep track of each week was difficult (pre-lab, post-lab, pset, design notebook) was challenging. I also definitely recommend a later lab if possible, since it just gives you more time for many assignments. But overall, lab was definitely my favorite 3 hours of the week!"

      "ES25 was one of the best courses I have ever taken but it should be taken with caution. While the description of the class said that it was designed for non-engineering concentrators and people without much stem background, I did not find the class to be taught this way. A good chunk of the material flew past my head without any solid understanding, simply because I couldn't understand the math/physics that was going on. For instance, we were introduced the wave equation in the unit on music theory and to call it a second order partial differential equation to people who don't know what a basic differential equation doesn't really enforce solid understanding of the material. If you were like me, a very musically involved person who wanted a more solid knowledge of acoustics etc, then I would recommend having at least a solid understanding of math and physics past linear algebra and electromagnetism respectively. Also, I had no prior coding experience and some assignments asked for some coding in python and I was a little lost-I would recommend the same kind of preparation with cs50 or something.",
      "This class is one of the only classes that encourages learning for the sake of learning!! And the content is amazing with a low work load. Rob is a phenomenal lecturer and resource on campus. I will be looking for every opportunity to be working with him again."

      "You're probably only taking this course because you have to. That said, it's a reasonably interesting topic that you might gain something out of. Dr Clarke does a good job of putting the material into context during lecture, but that is sometimes a detriment to the course, as much of the material covered in exams and problem sets comes directly from the textbook. The class typically only involved one problem set a week, and two exams during the semester. The final project did not seem onerous at first, but became so due to the extra topics that Clarke would suggest to us, and the lack of direction and specifics throughout the process. Overall, this is a solid engineering course that will likely be useful in the future, but the hands off approach to teaching added some unneeded stress to the class (why did we have problem sets completely unrelated to the lecture topics?). Also- this course does involve a fair amount of thermodynamics and fluids topics, but they are definitely not necessary for the class. You might actually gain something from taking this course before the other two.",

This course is meant to teach you how to apply methodologies to real problems, not to teach you those methodologies. At a minimum, do not take this course unless you have taken linear algebra and differential equations. It is definitely helpful to have taken some stats courses as well and something that has exposed you to programming (nothing crazy, CS50, Stat 111, or AM 120 should be sufficient)",

The first half (taught by Max) was relatively straightforward, though at times difficult for those who had not taken any econometrics before. Max's lectures were very organized. He was clear about expectations and he is a fantastic teacher. The second half (taught by Elie) was less straightforward but more interesting. The lectures were very disorganized, but our fantastically organized and available TF, Linh, more than made up for Elie's disorganization."

Did not feel like I learned anything in this course that I could not have figured out on my own in an hour of textbook reading.",
      "This course was deceivingly boring, as Rabin has a meandering and monotonous lecture style. Combined with the fact that the class is 2-hours long, there was never a lecture when I didn't almost nod off. The best classes were the group discussions and class presentations, where the class members were talking rather than the professor, which says a lot about lecture engagement. The material could have been very interesting, as Rabin's research is extremely insightful and unique, but the presentation of the material did not make for an effective learning experience. The psets were also quite repetitive and tedious, so we didn't really learn as much as we could have. The upside is that there's really not a huge amount of work, outside of the few written assignments and psets we had, but I'm not sure it'd be worth the time to take this class."

If you are interested in East Asia, as you clearly are if you are concentrating/secondarying in EAS, each week's lecture theme is an \"amuse-bouche\" into an aspect of East Asian Studies.",
      "This was not a very good class. Everything felt pretty disconnected and I feel like I learned a lot about small bits of random things (ex. the tale of gengi, chinese medicine, jinmin island) but I also feel like I did not really learn anything substantial or improve my writing skills that much. I am not sure in what format I would prefer to see the course be in, but I think that adding a few weeks of historical survey would be a good first step because I often felt like I was asked to write about things such as the rise of nationalism in Korea when I had no knowledge of Korean history to use as context and only three articles to work with. I feel like this class has potential but that it needs to be reevaluated. The professors and TF's were great people and great teachers but I feel like the course structure is what's at fault. If the department ever decides to put together a group of students and faculty to revisit the structure of the course, I would love to volunteer to be a part of it. Overall, this course is something I wish I did not have to take."

      "123xb is awesome -- the teachers are super kind, patient, and passionate about you, the students. Although you meet 5 times a week in Vanserg, you start to look forward to the trek every day and it becomes a kind of routine. I've developed a better bond with my classmates here than in other classes, partially because of the small class size/meeting every day, but mostly because all of the students come from Chinese heritage families and share similar values and backgrounds. This class will challenge you with all parts of the language, as well as to think about how you fit in your own family and culture. Highly recommend going to a drill section with fewer students so you get more opportunities to speak! Also, if you are an upperclassman, don't be afraid of taking this course! I really enjoyed it as a senior and am glad I did it, but definitely wished I started taking Chinese sooner on in my college career."

      "Writing a thesis can be one of the most rewarding experiences (academic and otherwise) you have in college. It's a great way to see if a career in academic research is what you want to pursue and you will become much closer to professors, grad students and other senior thesis writers by doing it. The EPS department is also a great place to do a senior thesis because of how much support they give students (like this class -- not all departments have this!). That said, a thesis is a huge time commitment and will take over your life so make sure the project is something that you're committed to doing and that you can work reasonably well with your advisor(s).",
      "Writing a thesis was probably the most rewarding academic experience of my time at Harvard. But it's also hard. Choose your topic, your advisor and the other courses you take carefully."

I loved this class and I can't recommend this course enough!",

      "If you wanna do CS and don't have proof-based math, TAKE this class. It's fun and enjoyable. You will want to come to class!",
      "The short answer is: Take this course for either of three reasons: first, you want to get to know many peers and possibly friends, second, you want a low workload course, or third, you feel like you need to brush up on your mathematics skills a bit. The reasons for this are as follows: The flipped-classroom method is excellent! Not only do you learn more in shorter period of time, but at the same time you get to know many people and make great friends. However, the course could really be on a higher level. The course content is very easy compared to a course on discrete mathematics at other top US schools (see UC Berkeley, MIT, for instance). Maybe this is because it is seen as \"only\" a preparation for the harder courses to come, but I still feel like I already knew too many topics even though I could not get enough points in the CS20 placement test and therefore opted to take the course anyways. (As for the placement test: it advises you to take the course, if you score \"half-half\". I would advise against that, as it was the case for me, and I felt like I could have gone straight to more advanced courses.) At the current level of difficulty, I believe most topics can be learned when they come up (i.e. probability when needed for a Stats class, graph theory when needed for an algorithms class, etc.), since we did not go into depth and instead, covered many different topics. Besides content, the course aims at teaching you a technique: to write good proofs. This is mostly what I was looking for in the course. In my opinion, it did not achieve it. It felt like 75% of the problems (in-class, and potentially a bit less for PSETs) were about: did you understand this mathematical concept, and can you apply it to examples? Only then does the course move on to proofs, which were about 25% of the course. That is really low, and I was expecting it to be the other way around. That is why I said, you can learn the material when necessary, and that it did not teach us much about proofs. (Adding a bit to this: Teaching about proofs is not only about teaching different methods of proofs, e.g. proof of contradiction, of induction etc. (which the course does, although there weren't many methods); it is also and more importantly, about the values that we cherish about good proofs, such as correctness, conciseness (= avoiding the unnecessary), use of mathematical terminology (= avoiding ambiguity), preciseness, structure, creativity ... the list probably goes on. A good academic writing course teaches you such values and gives you feedback as to how to improve upon them. That kind of feedback only focused on one value (correctness), so besides now knowing how to write a correct proof, I still do not feel like I know how to write a good proof. Side note: A further strength was that the materials where well presented and required to be well presented - i.e. in Latex. That is a wonderful tool to have learned. However, you might learn it in other courses anyways, or just teach it to yourself, because it is not that much work. So do not take this course just for Latex."

      "I don't know what the course was like before Eddie revamped it, but I thought this new version was great, even if a little rough around the edges as it was developed.",
      "If you took CS 61 and found the “operating systems” parts (i.e. WeensyOS) interesting, take this class! If you’ve wondered how core components of an operating system are implemented (such as the filesystem, buffer cache, device drivers, and more), take this class! CS 161 has changed (for the better, in my opinion, although I have no experience with the prior version), and in this new version you get hands-on experience with implementing an x86-64 operating system informed by concepts and designs from real-world operating systems like Linux. The problem sets build on each other, and by the end of it, combined with an open-ended final project, you’ll have an operating system complete with an on-disk filesystem, a shell, and maybe even networking or cool graphics! To say it’s fulfilling is an understatement. The class is a lot of work (i.e. a lot of code), but the problem sets do a good job of striking a balance between how much code you write (i.e. the interesting bits) and how much code is given to you (i.e. tedious and/or exceptionally finicky stuff like the disk driver). The lectures (by Professor Eddie Kohler) are engaging and given in a really effective informal-ish format, and the bi-weekly sections lead to fun discussions on interesting topics in OS development like system call design and containers. Before taking CS 161, I would recommend familiarity with C and/or C++ (you’ll be writing a log of it) and systems programming concepts at the level of CS 61. Although this class is not for everyone, it is one of the best classes I’ve taken at Harvard; by virtue of being hands-on, the class has allowed me to learn a lot I probably wouldn’t have otherwise."

      "CS148 was a very interesting class. The early portion of the class focused on evaluating delays in logic and circuits focused on broader concepts such as power, CAD tools, and memories and datapath logic (adders, multipliers...). The administrative part of the class was a bit lackluster. Problem sets were interesting overall but sometimes covered material we didn't learn in class completely and limited office hours (and no TF) made asking questions difficult. The textbook for the class is great though and Gu's lectures are always interesting as usual. Overall CS148 definitely made me more interested in VLSI chip design and I gained a lot of interesting knowledge that is hard to learn outside of a class. I fully recommend CS148 if you are interested in integrated circuit design and don't mind the class being a bit disorganized.",
      "Gu is one of the reasons I feel like paying tuition is warranted. He's hilarious, laid-back, gives a lot of personal attention to students, and not to mention unbelievably smart. As for the class, the material is really cool if you're interested in computer chip design. The class is also not a lot of work. There were 5 psets that only took a few hours each, and a final project (which was more like a guided lab) that was spaced out over the last 4 or 5 weeks. There was no TF, so we had to figure out everything on our own for psets."

Our TF Carrie's quick presentations about the basics of opera were helpful, but they were too infrequent and unconnected to the rest of the course to be very impactful. In our last class, we had a lecture/discussion on Don Giovanni, which was great! Unfortunately, though, that was the very last day. I wish things like that had begun earlier.",

      "At first, the readings don't seem to go together, but as the course progresses, unexpected similarities between authors start to pop up, and you will see some really interesting themes emerge",
      "I really wanted to like this course but I think you really, really need to be extremely interested in the European Renaissance and Italy to enjoy it till the end. The course draws most of its literature from less than a handful of countries in Europe, which I expected but couldn't help disliking, although we did read works by Hafiz and Jahan Malik Khatun; however I found it unfortunate and disappointing that we studied them alongside Goethe, as if for some reason we needed to add this European lens to such magnificent poets, and after them we never read any non-European literature again. I get that this course's Renaissance refers to the European Renaissance and that it started in Italy, but in that case why did we study Hafiz and Jahan Malik Khatun and not Fuzuli, or poetry from the Ming dynasty?--it made those readings feel tokenized. Furthermore, we focused so much on Italy that it became extremely exhausting. Initially I took this class because I wanted to read things I had never read before, and so I guess the class was still valuable in that regard, but I found myself becoming terribly disinterested and vaguely annoyed halfway through the semester due to the fact that we barely read any English, Spanish, or German writers, among writers from other Renaissance-influenced countries. However, the professor is very kind and cares a lot and we did have interesting discussions sometimes, although on some rare occasions the subversive part felt forced, irrelevant, or inappropriate for the situation. That being said, if you really love European Renaissance literature, especially from Italy, I highly recommend this class for you."

The reading amount is very manageable, the papers were very straightforward and not overwhelming (3 and 5 pages), and the exams were very fair in what they covered. The end of the syllabus provides the opportunity to read some lesser known Latin authors, which I really enjoyed. This course also ended up being a lot smaller than 112a when I took it in the Fall, which I found to my benefit. And Dr. Yolles is great; if he is teaching the course, definitely consider it!

I incredibly enjoyed going to class three days a week, and the fact that there were ~30 other people in the room who also cared as much about the material as I did was heartwarming. Yes, it is probably the largest Latin class the Classics department has ever seen, but if the facilitator of the discussion does their job (as Professor Tarrant did), then it does not hinder discussion at all. Make sure to stay on top of the readings, because understanding the Latin is the only way to truly be able to draw the connections that Ovid so masterfully weaves throughout the Metamorphoses. Also, it is worth mentioning that this class made me so much faster and more efficient at reading Latin, simply because of the volume of reading that I had to do. I am very grateful for it.",

      "This class was so incredible! I looked forward to it every week. We had a small section and we are able to spiritedly discuss and share our thoughts on the readings and our critiques of the scholars. Alex did an amazing job facilitating our discussions and providing productive background information and readings. The course assignments were very reasonable and easy to complete each week. Alex gave us plenty of time and advice to make the final paper not super stressful towards the end. Because we were able to choose our own topics (just had to be related in some way to books and libraries) I was able to write about something I was actually interested in.",

It is very fluid, however, as most of the semester is spent learning various digital humanities skills and applying them to one large scale research question and project, which everyone presents at the end of the semester. Professor Schiefsky knows this material really well and it was really great to learn from him and the other guest speakers he invited through the course of the semester.

The study load was pretty serious (a LOT of memorization) and the paper assignments were just so nebulous (never knew the page limit, or what he wanted exactly at all), but having been through it now I'd definitely opt-in again. I just know so much more than I did at the beginning of the semester about classical archaeology and Ancient Rome, more generally, and frankly it's really cool to be able to distinguish between the different styles of wall painting at sight. Definitely take if you're a concentrator. If not, take with the understanding that it's not the gem it appears to be, but that you'll come out of the class better for having taken it."

      "Professor Betley is, in some ways, the best professor I have come across at Harvard. He scheduled office hours at ideal times, including office hours with himself the night before and the 2 hours leading up to the due date. He is very helpful in these office hours but also a very nice, approachable and funny guy. I think many students at Harvard think they're 'too smart' for office hours, but I think they're key to getting the most out of this course. Some people who complain about the course may not be going to these office hours. Betley certainly wants you to understand the material, and do well. The lectures are very interesting, though they could be taught in a slightly more linear way. Ted sometimes begins with an example and then explains the concept, when the other way around might be a little easier to understand in some cases. However, a lot of this lack of clarity is down to the subject - Inorganic chemistry does, in its nature, use a lot of approximations, and doesn't always seem as straightforward and logical as Organic Chemistry, which most have taken before this course. The pset and exam questions often look at papers, many of them from the last decade, and it is exciting to be able to apply your knowledge from an introductory course to current research in this way. Overall, I'd recommend the course."

      "Two things must be taken into consideration. When the instructors advise you to teach things within a certain time period, do not follow these instructions! Do not prepare your teaching material to fit the time period, as you are instructed to do so. If you try to teach the material within the time allotted, you will be heavily criticized for teaching too quickly, potentially told you did not understand the material well, or that you must be unfamiliar with the material. You must, instead, make sure you pace yourself such that you do a thorough job explaining the material you are teaching and take your time teaching it well. Essentially, you are misinformed about the nature of the assignment, and you must not follow the direction to teach the material within the allotted time. Prepare such that you can answer all of the questions, and go through them carefully and thoroughly instead. When you run out of time and do not finish the equations, you will, if you explained the answers well, be told you did a good job explaining the question, and you will be confused since you didn't actually finish the questions within the allotted time, like you were asked to do! The second consideration is, you must prepare the material not to your most capable or fullest capacity. You must prepare the material without any addendum or side note, unless it is short and would brighten the audience and make them feel safe and think you are in control of the lecture. As a specific example, when asked to perform integrals in the lower-level, hand-wavy way by simply rationalizing the answer without doing some serious calculus, DO NOT do serious calculus. Simply rationalize the answer, DO NOT explain any in depth mathematical computation, DO NOT do any more than is barely necessary to solve the problem. DO mention how fun the picture you've drawn to understand the integral looks, and how much it resembles ping-pong balls bouncing around an enclosure, like a clear balloon. This will put the instructors at ease and convince them that you are able to connect with the class and explain things at the introductory level.",

      "The course is extremely good. Almost no chemistry background is required to take it, and the course is so well-structured and well-taught (with ample practice materials) that you can't help but appreciate it even when things are pretty tough.",
      "There is a certain myth surrounding organic chemistry about the horrors of it, which I would personally like to disagree with after having taken chem20. This class was definitely a very enjoyable class (not to be confused with \"no work\") - I loved going to lectures (in my opinion, Logan is an excellent lecturer and you will have plenty of reasons for why his lectures are structured in an entertaining manner without losing the rigour of the material taught), and really enjoyed working on my PSETs (I would compare them to puzzles). I definitely learnt a lot about problem solving techniques through synthesis questions, and unlike some might argue, this class actually requires very little rote memorisation. By the nature of the class, there is a lot of emphasis on the application of the synthesis blocks you have learnt about and applying to harder synthesis questions. It requires you to essentially find one of the right paths through a maze that has a start and end point. So if you are afraid that organic chemistry is just learning the synthesis for various compounds off by heart, I hope you trust me when I say that there is a much greater emphasis on understanding and application than memorisation. Also, this class is extremely well organised and there is a lot of support available to you to help you get through. From a mound of practice exams, to extra help room hours, there is more than enough opportunity to get the help you need if you are feeling stuck or lost. Logan is also very respectful of your time and understands that chem20 is not the only course you are taking. PSETs are reasonable (but challenging), and again there is plenty of help available to you during the week, and you will always finish material 2 - 3 weeks before your next midterm, so you have plenty of time to study (additionally, in the week before midterms you are not assigned any extra work, which is very considerate and helpful). I would also suggest that you take this course over Chem17. Students who take Chem20 historically, for the most part, have an interest in the material beyond just completing a requirement. You will find classmates to work with who genuinely enjoy figuring out the questions on the PSET, and it is generally an environment where there are quite a number of students who enjoy the intellectual rigour of chemistry. So if you are someone who loves chemistry, you should definitely take chem20, and if you are someone who would like to learn organic chemistry in a way that is not hyper focused on the grade, but also on the intellectual endeavour, then take chem20. Also, chem20 is historically a much smaller class than chem17, so there is more time available per student (in terms of office hours, help room etc.), and you can form some relatively close relationships in the class."

Prof. Sumner is very enthusiastic and dedicated to helping you understand the language, and she makes learning it fun - we played a variety of different games and did different activities to reinforce concepts. The workload was very manageable but still effective."

      "This class did not meet my expectations. Although it was listed in the biostatistics department, there was little to no statistics content in the lectures. It seemed as though the TFs and professor were too busy with other obligations, which led to a lot of guest lectures, disorganized flow of topics, only 2 assignments throughout the semester, and overall confusion for the students in terms of what topics are important to retain. There was also no computation at all, which was disappointing for me personally. Although many of the lectures were interesting, without assignments to reinforce learning, I ended up retaining relatively little from the class. The professor is a superstar researcher and interesting guy, but just too busy to run an organized class."

However two of the three TFs are leaving after this semester so good luck if you want to take this course. I feel that this course has really fall short of my expectation. The idea of the course is to let us derive everything, so the lectures are very unhelpful. The readings assigned is often unrelated to lecture, and the staffs haven't read the readings at all, which explains why such a badly written and formatted book is chosen. Some concept confused me are not even explained in detail by the professor just because \"there's no joy in teaching it\". (which I totally understand, but kind of irresponsible for the students...)"

HOWEVER, I don't know that I've ever learned so much from a single course before, so looking from the side of completion, I'd say this course is definitely worth taking if you can stomach a sizeable time commitment. (I think there's also something to be said for my iteration of this course being the first time it's offered. It seems like Chris is going to tone down the difficulty of the homeworks in future years.) I'd also comment that this is almost as much a programming course as a math course and is a great bridge between methods and implementations. That being said, be prepared to learn C++."

If you have a good math background, and some previous optimization experience, I think this could be a good course. If you're seeing the concepts for the first time, I would stress that to get much out of the class will take a lot of self study. Additionally, there was an assignment every week (not small assignments either), which unfortunately made focusing on the final project difficult to balance."

      "It's always good to know more maths. So take maths. But should you take this course? It depends. My short answer is: I would go for the flipped-section in the other 21B course, since you will likely learn more in less time and get to know your peers (an important aspect of your college life ;)). Now, for this course, you might want to know, that you can learn most of it by going to section and doing the homework. Find a study group or go to OH, and you will be fine. Other than that, it wasn't very inspiring, thought-provoking ... - or fun. It was very much like a high school maths course: learn how to calculate an inner product -> calculate an inner product. The only difference being that a few times, there were applications to some scientific disciplines, so to understand why we actually learn those methods. That's fun, but we did too little of it I found. In summary, the course was more something to get done with, because you want to know the material for something more advanced. In general, the course is really repetitive. Not much creativity or transfer is asked for. The exam has same questions as in homework. Yes, it takes away some pressure, but at the same time, that also means less skills are being acquired. On the positive side, I liked the enthusiasm of the professor. I like that he has a firm opinion on teaching methods and styles, and incorporated his own philosophy. That shows that he was motivated to help us grow. Shop the course, to see if you like his philosophy. Other than that, he was also interested in getting to know his students and incorporate them in class by asking a question every now and then. In conclusion: I am not a fan of lectures in mathematics and just want to learn by doing. That is why I would take a flipped-section next time.",
      "You're probably only thinking about taking this class if you have to take a linear algebra class for a concentration requirement. One problem set per week was nice versus three in Math 21b, but there isn't much else to be excited about here. Just grin and bear it."

At the same time, though, it is incredibly applicable: I feel I've learned more useful real-life techniques in this one course than in any two or three other courses I can think of all put together. And it was all very well taught too! Indeed, I enthusiastically recommend AM207. It'd be particularly useful if you are interested in machine learning, Bayesian statistics, or data science more broadly. My background is in economics, a field the course doesn't even attempt to connect with, and I still found numerous topics taught in AM207 directly applicable to much research in my field. Take AM207 to learn tons, and to have fun. It takes time and effort, but not as much as Rahul makes it sound like in the first week."

While this class is more focused on the history of Mexico and its foods than a sociological analysis of foodie culture, I did find it helpful in becoming more thoughtful and aware of how I defined food \"authenticity\" and how so much history lies behind different food items. Although the course content was really interesting, I found the lectures to be a bit dry and not very invigorating. However, we did have a few interactive events interspersed throughout lectures (food tastings, lab activities), and we also got to see and touch ancient artifacts in section, so that kept the class exciting. The one large portion of work that the class demands is bi-weekly quizzes. Although there are study guides for each quiz, the study guides require you to memorize literally everything mentioned in lecture + important reading ideas to do well on the quiz. This is the only stressful part of the class though, so I think it was not a huge con!",

I had never taken a history/anthropology/archeology course before, and I felt like I learned a great deal about how each discipline views the world. Professors Leibmann and Smail give very engaging lectures and are eager to get to know the students, which I was very impressed with. They are clearly passionate about teaching deep history and were receptive to feedback throughout the course. They also effectively encouraged class participation, and \"lecture\" went above and beyond in terms of interactive components. The TFs were also very supportive and I found section similarly engaging. This is a manageable class even for those with no history background- I did not find any part particularly challenging.",
      "This class is super interesting, and you get access to the cool collections in the Peabody. It is disorganized at times and the feedback on assignments is not always clear."
