cloudmedx inc,FOUND,www.cloudmedxhealth.com,active,"CloudMedx was started with the aim to make healthcare affordable, accessible and standardized for all patients and doctors. The foundation of the company is based on a near death experience that one of the founder's father experienced as a result of a misdiagnosis. CloudMedx uses NLP and deep learning to extract key clinical concepts from the electronic health records and serve them as insights to physicians and care teams with the goal to improve clinical operations, documentation, and patient care.
The process of care delivery is very high touch and labor intensive. This introduces overhead and inefficiencies that can be automated. It turns highly qualified physicians, nurses, coders, billers, and care staff into data entry personal whereas most of these processes are repetitive and can be easily automated.
In order to tackle this, CloudMedx, has built an AI Assistant with the aim to help physicians and patients use their own data to make data driven decisions. CloudMedx has a proprietary Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning infrastructure that can be integrated into Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and help doctors automate their daily workflows around identification of risk, care planning, and revenue cycle management.
